# Crypto-Arbitrage-between-CEX-and-DEX
This project was used for crypto arbitrage between CEX and DEX. All the codes in the project is based on **Python**.  Main modules in Python: redis, web3, ccxt.  In the project, we use **Redis** as the database, since all the data will be store in the memory, making the process of storing and reading would be quicker, which is necessary for a arbitrage programme.
